[Party 1]
Name=Lady's Lament
Descr1=The Lady's Lament is a group of adventurers that hails from the City of Splendors, Waterdeep.  They have a reputation for being soft spoken, reserved, and somewhat melancholy.  However, they are also known for championing the underdog, and often accept difficult assignments that other groups pass up.  Hearing of the beleaguered town of Targos, they quickly traveled to Luskan and joined the throngs of mercenaries heading for Icewind Dale.  The group is named after their leader, Sheris Lyricist.
Descr2=Sheris (Chaotic Good, Female, Human, Bard): STR: 12, DEX: 14, CON: 10, INT: 14, WIS: 10, CHA: 16, Skills: Bluff (4), Hide (4), Concentration (4), Diplomacy (4), Move Silently (2), Feats: Courteous Magocracy, Dodge.
Descr3=Geldin (Lawful Neutral, Male, Half-orc, Fighter): STR: 20, DEX: 16, CON: 16, INT: 8, WIS: 8, CHA: 6, Skills: Intimidate (4), Move Silently (3), Feats: Ambidexterity, Two Weapon Fighting.
Descr4=Khatja (Chaotic Good, Female, Half-orc, Barbarian): STR: 18, DEX: 14, CON: 14, INT: 10, WIS: 12, CHA: 6, Skills: Intimidate (4), Wilderness Lore (4), Feats: Martial Weapon - Greatsword.
Descr5=Laeris (Lawful Good, Male, Human, Cleric - Painbearer of Ilmater): STR: 12, DEX: 12, CON: 12, INT: 12, WIS: 16, CHA: 12, Skills: Concentration (4), Knowledge (Arcana) (4), Spellcraft (2), Feats: Combat Casting, Toughness.
Descr6=Vraedna (Chaotic Neutral, Female, Drow, Sorceror): STR: 10, DEX: 14, CON: 14, INT: 16, WIS: 10, CHA: 16, Skills: Alchemy (4), Concentration (4), Knowledge (Arcana) (4), Spellcraft (4), Feats: Combat Casting.

Descr8=Sheris was the spoiled daughter of a Waterdeep noble.  She took advantage of her family's wealth and power to live a pampered, unproductive life.  Her only true love was music, and this was the one thing that she tried to excel at.  Sheris fled her home when she discovered that her father had arranged a marriage for her.  Unsuited for any other profession, she became a bard.  Geldin and Khatja, a half-orc couple, are the muscle of the Lady's Lament.  Geldin follows the orderly path of the warrior, while Khatja believes in the ferocity and chaos of the barbarian.  Together they pose a mighty force.  Neither will speak much of their past, only saying that they are not accepted by orc or human alike.  Laeris, the cleric of Ilmater, is the spiritual guiding force of the party.  He is a humble man who speaks little, and asks even less.  He often uses his great wisdom to complement Sheris' charisma.  Vraedna, the sorcerer, is the arcane power of the party.  As a drow maiden, she turned away from the worship of Llolth and fled the underdark.  She stays with the Lady's Lament hoping to share in their good reputation.  Her greatest fear is to be deserted and left on her own in the surface world.  Kylie, the halfling rogue, is the prankster of the party.  His life's goal is to wipe the frown from his teammate's faces, or at the very least, make them laugh once in a while.  Having been with the Lady's Lament for several years, he fully understands the meaning of 'misery loves company.'

[Party 2]
Name =Sisters of the Blood Moon
Descr1 =Drawn together under the watchful and accepting eye of Selune, more-so for their differences than similarities, the young adventuring party known as the Sisters of the Blood Moon have made it their mission to help those that are oppressed, abused, and in dire need of aid.  Their leader, S'feria Ranul, a drow Silverstar of Selune who normally resides in the city of Silverymoon, gathered her adventuring sisters together one day, and presented them the note of requested aid from the troubled town of Targos.  The promise of gold from Targos was not the motivating factor for the party to go and help.  It was their bond and their oath to help all those who asked, and they did not hesitate to charter a ship to take the Sisters of the Blood Moon to Targos.

Descr2 =S'feria Ranul (Chaotic Good, Female, Drow, Cleric - Silverstar of Selune): STR: 14, DEX: 12, CON: 10, INT: 12, WIS: 18, CHA: 14, Skills: Concentration (4), Diplomacy (4), Feats: Simple Weapon - Mace.
Descr3 =Oagla'ta (Chaotic Good, Female, Half-orc, Barbarian): STR: 20, DEX: 12, CON: 14, INT: 8, WIS: 10, CHA: 10, Skills: Intimidate (4), Feats: Martial Weapon - Axe.
Descr4 =Nyzeil Nighthammer (Chaotic Good, Female, Gray Dwarf, Fighter): STR: 18, DEX: 12, CON: 16, INT: 10, WIS: 12, CHA: 6, Skills: Intimidate (4), Feats: Bullheaded, Martial Weapon - Hammer.
Descr5 =Nevae Quar (Neutral Good, Female, Half-elf, Ranger): STR: 14, DEX: 16, CON: 12, INT: 10, WIS: 12, INT: 10, CHA: 12, Skills: Animal Empathy (4), Wilderness Lore (4), Feats: Martial Weapon - Bow.
Descr6 =Hylei Shadowhand (Neutral Good, Female, Rock Gnome, Illusionist): STR: 8, DEX: 14, CON: 12, INT: 18, WIS: 12, CHA: 12, Skills: Alchemy (4), Concentration (4), Hide: (2), Knowledge (Arcana) (4), Spellcraft (4), Feats: Combat Casting, Courteous Magocracy.
Descr7 =Kylei Shadowhand (Chaotic Good, Female, Rock Gnome, Rogue): STR: 8, DEX: 18, CON: 14, INT: 14, WIS: 10, CHA: 12, Skills: Bluff (4), Disable Device (4), Hide (4), Open Lock (4), Pick Pocket (4), Search (4), Feats: Dodge.
Descr8 ="This isn't a proper place for a band of ladies."  How many times had S'feria Ranul heard this phrase, and those like it?  More than she cared to count.  But those that uttered such phrases of warning knew little of S'feria, and her Sisters of the Blood Moon.  Born in the Underdark city of Sshamath, but raised by Moon Elves within the surface city of Silverymoon, S'feria Ranul grew to be a sophisticated, driven, and caring priest of Selune - also known as a Silverstar of Selune.  She is able to push aside most people's discriminatory comments, and change their minds in favor of acceptance and tolerance.  It was these qualities, and her strength of leadership, that brought together other women of similar thinking, tenacity and strength, to form the Sisters of the Blood Moon.  Oagla'ta is a half-orc barbarian female of great size and strength, even for her male counterparts of the breed.  Her female gray dwarf companion, Nyzeil Nighthammer, is equally formidable for her kind. However, neither shared the dark hearts that their heritage usually elicited.  They both joined the Sisters of the Blood Moon when S'feria showed an act of kindness by interfering with the Silverymoon guards' intolerable, and discriminatory behavior towards the two women.  Oagla'ta and Nyzeil are both extremely proficient with axes and warhammers, and usually exceed any male warriors of their race.  Nevae Quar is a female half-elf, a gifted archer, and a young ranger who was befriended by twin female gnomes; Hylei Shadowhand, an illusionist who favors deception over harm, and Kylei Shadowhand, a rogue with a propensity towards pick pocketing.  The three women had a chance meeting with S'feria and her troupe when S'feria, Oagla'ta and Nyzeil were ambushed by a dozen goblins in the forest outside of Silverymoon.  Nevae and her friends did not hesitate to help the ambushed women when they came upon them.  Thanks to Nevae and the Shadowhand twins, the battle was over before it really had a chance to begin, much to the disappointment of Oagla'ta and Nyzeil.  However, S'feria was enthralled with how well all the women worked together in the battle with the goblins, and knew that the Sisters of the Blood Moon would be complete with Nevae and the Shadowhand twins - who were overjoyed at the chance of joining an official adventuring party.

[Party 3]
Name= The Winter Rose
Descr1=Named for the Frostrose, whose petals remain crimson in even the harshest climates, this fellowship is founded on the unwavering commitment to duty.  Just as it is the duty of the Frostrose to keep its scarlet hue against the snow-covered wastes, so too must the fellows of the Winter Rose hold to their covenant as self-proclaimed guardians of the North.
Descr2=The Watcher (Lawful Good, Male, Aasimar, Paladin of Helm): STR: 16, DEX: 10, CON: 12, INT: 10, WIS: 14, CHA: 18, Skills: Concentration (1), Diplomacy (3), Feats: Luck of Heroes.
Descr3=Kebb Trapmaster (Neutral Good, Male, Rock Gnome, Rogue): STR: 10, DEX: 18, CON: 12, INT: 14, WIS: 12, CHA: 10, Skills: Disable Device (4), Hide (4), Move Silently (4), Open Lock (4), Pick Pocket (4), Search (4), Feats: Rapid Shot.
Descr4=Tianya (Neutral Good, Female, Half-elf, Druid): STR: 12, DEX: 12, CON: 12, INT: 10, WIS: 18, CHA: 12, Skills: Animal Empathy (4), Wilderness Lore (4), Feats: Simple Weapon - Missile (2).
Descr5=Naleen (Lawful Good, Female, Tiefling, Monk of the Broken Ones): STR: 14, DEX: 16, CON: 12, INT: 10, WIS: 18, CHA: 8, Skills: Hide (4), Move Silently (4), Feats: Dodge.
Descr6=Llendril Coe (Neutral Good, Female, Moon Elf, Bard): STR: 10, DEX: 14, CON: 12, INT: 12, WIS: 12, CHA: 16, Skills: Alchemy (4), Bluff (3), Concentration (2), Knowledge (Arcana) (3) Feats: Lingering Song.
Descr7=Dalwynd Meadsbreath (Chaotic Good, Male, Lightfoot Halfling, Wizard): STR: 8, DEX: 14, CON: 12, INT: 18, WIS: 10, CHA: 14, Skills: Alchemy (4), Concentration (4), Diplomacy (2), Knowledge (Arcana) (4), Spellcraft (4), Feats: Simple Weapon - Crossbow, Spell Focus - Enchantment (1).
Descr8=The Watcher, Sirge de La Sunya of Amn, is the founder of the fellowship.  His father, Don Di’Armos, was a respected noble and Watcher of Helm in the city of Athkatla.  On his deathbed, the Don told his son of a sister he had in the far off land of Damara.  During a very long and lonely expedition, he found companionship with a strange woman in the wilderness.  When the woman gave birth to their child, she revealed herself as a demon.  Don Di’Armos destroyed the demon but could not bring himself to murdering a child, even a demon child.  He took the abomination to a monastery and left it for the monks to care for.  The revelation caused Sirge to question all that he had ever believed.  He abandoned his duties to the church and to House de La Sunya and determined to search for his sister.  Kebb Trapmaster is The Watcher’s squire.  He earned his name as a member of the infamous Shadow Thief Guild. Uncomfortable with the Shadow Thieves’ penchant for killing, he saw it as a blessing when he was sentenced to indentured servitude.  More than a mere squire, Kebb is Sirge’s teacher and closest friend. Naturally, he joined the knight when he left Amn.  Tianya is a beautiful half-elf druid. She was left to the whims of nature when she was just a child, abandoned by parents who wished to keep her from spoiling their "perfect" lives.  It was by chance that she joined the fellowship. Sirge found his sister, the tiefling Naleen, at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.  He could not bring himself to revealing his true relationship to her.  So, he introduced himself as “The Watcher” and invited her to join the Winter Rose.  With a deep desire to see the world beyond the walls of the monastery, she accepted.  Llendril and Dalwynd are the newest members of the Winter Rose.  Llendril is a descendent of the Elves of the Hand. She has decided to return to her ancestral home, hoping to fill the once beautiful halls with the music that was born there. Dalwynd was the greatest pie thief of his hamlet.  From an early age he could talk his way out of what most halflings had to sneak their way out of.  When Dalwynd left his Shire in the company of these adventurers, one would think the little people of the Shire would have been happy to see the little pie smuggler go, but as is always the case with family they miss him more than they missed those pies.  The two have done much to lighten the hearts of this band of adventurers.

[Party 4]
Name=Annals of Halgren
Descr1=This weary band has sprouted up in the shadow of Halgren Death's Head, a dwarf from the Bruenghor Clan in the Sunset Mountains, a mountain range far to the south of Icewind Dale.  Their leader, Halgren, seeks enough wealth so that he may erase the stain of his family name from the bloody crimes of one his ancestors, a vicious dwarf known as Kaervas.  The troop gathered in Luskan barely a tenday ago.  Neither evil nor especially law-abiding, the group tends to honor their word and stick to their cause, which is furthering their own name... and erase the stain from Halgren's.
Descr2=Halgren Death's Head (Lawful Neutral, Male, Shield Dwarf, Fighter): STR: 18, DEX: 14, CON: 14, INT: 10, WIS: 8, CHA: 12, Skills: Intimidate (4), Feats: Cleave, Power Attack.
Descr3=Bastinado (Chaotic Neutral, Male, Human, Ranger): STR: 18, DEX: 14, CON: 14, INT: 10, WIS: 10, CHA: 10, Skills: Animal Empathy (4), Hide (2), Wilderness Lore (4), Feats: Martial Weapon - Bow, Martial Weapon - Large Sword.
Descr4=Alia Shield-Maiden (True Neutral, Female, Shield Dwarf, Cleric - Battleguard of Tempus): STR: 16, DEX: 12, CON: 12, INT: 10, WIS: 18, CHA: 8, Skills: Concentration (4), Feats: Combat Casting.
Descr5=Silence-Before-Iron (Lawful Neutral, Female, Tiefling, Monk of the Old Order): STR: 16, DEX: 20, CON: 12, INT: 10, WIS: 16, CHA: 4, Skills: Move Silently (4), Feats: Power Attack.
Descr6=Mordakai of Thay (Lawful Neutral, Male, Human, Sorcerer): STR: 10, DEX: 10, CON: 12, INT: 14, WIS: 12, CHA: 18, Skills: Alchemy (4), Concentration (4), Diplomacy (2), Knowledge (Arcana) (4), Feats: Combat Casting, Spell Focus - Evocation.
Descr7=Kei the Wooden Idol (Chaotic Neutral, Female, Half-elf, Rogue): STR: 12, DEX: 18, CON: 12, INT: 12, WIS: 10, CHA: 12, Skills: Disable Device (4), Hide (4), Move Silently (4), Open Lock (4), Search (4), Feats: Martial Weapon - Bow.
Descr8=Halgren Death's Head, the party leader, is a dwarven warrior with impressive skills with the axe and crossbow; his strength and toughness allow him to be a front line all to himself.  He is haunted by the crimes of his ancestor, who was rumored to be a dark dwarf, and he is forever seeking to amass wealth (and fame), so that he may redeem his family's name.  Bastinado claims to have wandered all over the Realms as a pirate, fisherman, mercenary, tinker, scout, and a forester.  He is skilled with all manner of weapons, and his great strength, endurance, and tendency to remain in good spirits no matter what the situation has been the glue that has kept the band together on their long journey from Luskan. When battle calls, he takes Halgren's left side in confrontations, watching out for his leader.  Halgren's wife, Alia the Shield-Maiden, has traveled with him for nearly a decade, and she has turned from the dwarven gods to serve Tempus, lending her clerical powers to Halgren's cause.  She believes the path the band walks will be a bloody one, and she keeps a journal of their travels. When blades are drawn, she typically covers Halgren's right, earning her the name "Shield-Maiden."  Silence-Before-Iron is a monk from Amn.  She has the touch of the lower planes about her, and her monastic vows and fiendish blood make her keep to herself.  Silence-Before-Iron follows an order of monks who wield ideals in the place of weapons, embracing such aspects as silence, shadow, ice, fear, or wind before the iron of a mace or edge of a sword.  Mordakai of Thay turned from his Thayan kin and fled north and west after his sorcererous powers were discovered by his fellow Red Wizards.  Abandoning his apprenticeship, the sorcerer welcomed a journey into the North where he felt he could be at home amongst the ice and snow.  He is far less bloodthirsty than his fellow Red Wizards, and he is constantly seeking to set himself apart from them with his own actions.  Kei the Wooden Idol claims she was once nothing more than a wooden sculpture that was animated and turned into a living, breathing woman - one of her many tales that tends to raise a skeptical eyebrow over a tavern meal, since her ears mark her as having elven blood.  She is a pleasant rogue, always quick with a joke - or to jig a lock or slip out at night to peek at what the local rich merchants are up to.  Her skills tend to keep her a discrete distance from front-line fighting.

Name = The Hands of Fury
Descr1 =A group of unpleasant adventurers from along the Sword Coast, the Hands of Fury have a tendency to bully and brutalize people they encounter in their travels.  After traveling to Luskan with a group of pirates, their planned expedition with the crew fell through.  Stranded in Luskan, they decided to seek out their fortune with the packs of mercenaries sent to aid Targos.  Their overbearing leader, Makados, gave the group its name.
Descr2 =Makados (Chaotic Evil, Male, Human, Cleric - Stormlord of Talos): STR: 14, DEX: 12, CON: 10, INT: 10, WIS: 14, CHA: 16, Skills: Bluff (2), Intimidate (1), Feats: Toughness, Simple Weapon - Mace.
Descr3 =Dahel Bloody-Four (Chaotic Evil, Male, Human, Barbarian): STR: 16, DEX: 16, CON: 18, INT: 8, WIS: 10, CHA: 8, Skills: Intimidate (2), Wilderness Lore (4), Feats: Dodge, Martial Weapon - Axe.
Descr4 =Amraith (Neutral Evil, Male, Moon Elf, Fighter): STR: 10, DEX: 20, CON: 10, INT: 14, WIS: 14, CHA: 8, Skills: Intimidate (4), Knowledge (Arcana) (2), Wilderness Lore (2), Feats: Ambidexterity, Two Weapon Fighting.
Descr5 =Mirai Wainwright (Chaotic Neutral, Female, Half-elf, Wizard): STR: 10, DEX: 14, CON: 14, INT: 18, WIS: 10, CHA: 10, Skills: Alchemy (4), Concentration (4), Hide (2), Spellcraft (4), Feats: Rapid Shot, Simple Weapon - Missile.
Descr6 =Harbesh Carver (True Neutral, Male, Shield Dwarf, Rogue): STR: 16, DEX: 10, CON: 18, INT: 14, WIS: 10, CHA: 8, Skills: Disable Device (4), Hide (4), Move Silently (4), Open Lock (4), Pick Pocket (4), Search (4), Feats: Simple Weapon - Small Blade.
Descr7 =Fissera (Neutral Evil, Male, Human, Druid): STR: 10, DEX: 10, CON: 10, INT: 16, WIS: 16, CHA: 14, Skills: Animal Empathy (4), Bluff (2), Concentration (4), Diplomacy (4), Intimidate (2), Search (1), Spellcraft (4), Wilderness Lore (4), Feats: Luck of Heroes, Simple Weapon - Missile.
Descr8 =Makados, a proud Stormlord of Talos, is an intimidating, charismatic figure.  Though he is a priest, he is perfectly fit for front-line battle.  This is good, since Makados usually picks fights with people the party encounters.  Dahel Bloody-Four, a barbarian from the Western Heartlands, is even more bloodthirsty than Makados.  Though he's a bit dim and not particularly strong for a barbarian, his speed and incredible endurance make him a dangerous opponent.  He earned his nickname from a barfight where he killed four combatants out of sheer malice after he had already beat them into unconsciousness.  The dispossessed elven noble, Amraith, is a cool and efficient warrior.  Quicker than anyone else in the Hands of Fury, he is often the last one standing at the end of their "disputes".  He also has a quick mind, making him a bit more versatile than simple Dahel.  Mirai Wainwright is the lone woman in the Hands of Fury, but her position as the party's only arcane spellcaster makes her quite valuable.  A half-elf, she does not have the terrific speed of Amraith, but nor does she suffer his frailty.  She is quite intelligent, strong-willed, and surprisingly, physically strong.  The other dispossessed outcast in the party, Harbesh Carver, is a capable dwarven rogue and all-around thug.  Strong, smart, and tough, he leaves discussion to Makados and the others.  He is a grumpy individual who warms up more to a difficult lock than a friendly stranger.  The last member of the group, Fissera, is an angry, aggressive druid who makes a terrible companion for Makados.  Wise and profound in all the worst ways, Fissera waits for Makados to give the signal, then unleashes nature's worst wrath on anyone who stands in their way.  Unlike Makados and the rest of the "front-line", Fissera does not consider himself particularly well-suited for front-line combat.
